# Project-AGNI
AGNI (Advanced Ground-test Node for Ignition) is a custom PCB for rocket motor test stand. Built on ESP32-S2, it serves as the central node for ignition safety, load cell amplifier, accelerometer, thermocouples, and wireless telemetryâ€”enabling safe ignition, thrust measurement, and real-time data logging.
